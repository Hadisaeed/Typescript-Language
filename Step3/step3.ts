//TypeScript doesn’t require strict datatype matching, either. 
//TypeScript uses what the specification calls “structural subtyping” to determine compatibility. 
//This is similar to what’s often called “duck typing.” 

//Case when "FRESH"" object literal are assigned to a variable 
//Rule: When a fresh object literal is assigned to a variable or passed for a parameter of a non-empty target type, 
//it is an error for the object literal to specify properties that don't exist in the target type.
//The rationale for the below two errors is that since the fresh types of the object literals are 
//never captured in variables, static knowledge of the excess or misspelled properties should not be silently lost. 

let myType = { name: "Zia", id: 1 };
//Case 1
myType = { id: 2,  name: "Tom" };//Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties
								//Object literals can only have properties that exist in contextual type
//case 2a
//myType={id:3,name_person:"Tom"} //error , renamed or missing property
var x: { id: number, [x: string]: any };//Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
x = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia" };  // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature
//Case 3
//myType = { id: 2,  name: "Tom", age: 22 };//Case 3: Error, excess property


//Case when STALE object literal are assigned to a variable 
let myType2 = { id: 2,  name: "Tom" };
//Case 1
myType = myType2;//Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties, rule same for fresh and stale object

let myType3 = { id: 2,  name_person: "Tom" };
//Case 2a
myType = myType3;//Case 2: Error, renamed or missing property, rule same for stale and fresh object 


//Case 2b
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:

var x: { id: number, [x: string]: any };//Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
var y = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia" };
x = y;// Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature


var myType4 = { id: 2,  name: "Tom", age: 22 };
//Case 3
myType = myType4;//Case 3: Ok, excess property allowed in case of stale object which is different from fresh object
