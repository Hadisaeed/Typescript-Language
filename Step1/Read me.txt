TypeScript is a strongly typed language.suppose 
once you have declared a variable to be of 
type string ,you can only assign string values to 
it.All further code that uses this variables
must treat it as though it has a type of string.


The TypeScript syntax for declaring the type of a
variable is to include a colon (:), after variable 
name.

For example:


var Name:Variable_type= value;

var myname:string="Hadi";
